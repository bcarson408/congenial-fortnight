{code}
Unacceptable disk performance has been discovered on /dev/sdb.  This disk is in a raid1 mirror/stripe.  The difference of await performance values from this drive compared to the other drives in the mdadm array are significant enough that if the drive remains in the array, it will degrade performance.  We are better off by failing this disk out of the mdadm array preemptively than allowing it to continue.  The drive triggered threshold failures at least 3 times over a 24 hour period, so it wasnt just a single bogus reading.  We have automatically failed this device out of mdadm arrays.  The DCTECHS should eject the disk with hardware_failure.py -z to light the LED.  The device has already failed out of the mdadm arrays.  This hardware fault must be manually flushed, we can not compare outputs with previous execution to determine health.

Hello LCA1 Techs
Please replace the Cables/Optics for lca1-c9-asw15.nw.linkedin.com port 0/218
        
Please contact NEO team for any questions.

To run the script follow the below steps

        1) Login to lva1-netops01.prod.linkedin.com
        2) To failout traffic from the affected links do the below
        3) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket>
        4) Once the script is exectuded, and the ports are taken down, proceed with your work. Some steps below to troubleshoot
            Run iLOM fiber test
            Based on test results clean fiber
            Run the test again and if it's still showing high loss or high reflection replace the fiber
            If the interface is still down or flapping, replace the optic on one side.
            Test again.
            If the issue is still there, replace the optic on the other side.
            Run iLOM test.
            Verify that the interface is up with no errors or flaps.
        4) Once work is complete, perform the below script to bring back the traffic.
        5) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --failback
        6) If the link doesn't come back up, perform the below step
        7) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --check_port
        8) If the link is verified good after 24 hrs, the DCTECHS ticket will be auto closed.

{code}
Unacceptable disk performance has been discovered on /dev/sdb.  This disk is in a raid1 mirror/stripe.  The difference of await performance values from this drive compared to the other drives in the mdadm array are significant enough that if the drive remains in the array, it will degrade performance.  We are better off by failing this disk out of the mdadm array preemptively than allowing it to continue.  The drive triggered threshold failures at least 3 times over a 24 hour period, so it wasnt just a single bogus reading.  We have automatically failed this device out of mdadm arrays.  The DCTECHS should eject the disk with hardware_failure.py -z to light the LED.  The device has already failed out of the mdadm arrays.  This hardware fault must be manually flushed, we can not compare outputs with previous execution to determine health.

The server lca1-tools491.corp.linkedin.com - FCH1850V25Y is out of warranty and we
do not have spare parts to repair this server. SysOps will deallocate
this host and reallocate a new host for your team if deemed necessary.
In order to proceed, we will need the approval to take this server
down. We are attempting to proactively provide a solution before there
is any customer impact due to not being able to repair this host.

Approved, but requires additional approval from [~dhicks] or [eng-labs delegate|https://oncall.prod.linkedin.com/team/eng-labs]. The range cluster this host belongs to was created for SYSOPS-34111[1]. No topology/rain deployed applications are running on the host[2].

Host is additionally running an extremely old version of couchbase[3]. There are no records of who installed it or how it is used.

Hello LCA1 Techs
Please replace the Cables/Optics for lca1-c6-asw07.nw.linkedin.com port 0/219
        
Please contact NEO team for any questions.

To run the script follow the below steps

        1) Login to lva1-netops01.prod.linkedin.com
        2) To failout traffic from the affected links do the below
        3) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket>
        4) Once the script is exectuded, and the ports are taken down, proceed with your work. Some steps below to troubleshoot
            Run iLOM fiber test
            Based on test results clean fiber
            Run the test again and if it's still showing high loss or high reflection replace the fiber
            If the interface is still down or flapping, replace the optic on one side.
            Test again.
            If the issue is still there, replace the optic on the other side.
            Run iLOM test.
            Verify that the interface is up with no errors or flaps.
        4) Once work is complete, perform the below script to bring back the traffic.
        5) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --failback
        6) If the link doesn't come back up, perform the below step
        7) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --check_port
        8) If the link is verified good after 24 hrs, the DCTECHS ticket will be auto closed.

Hello LCA1 Techs
Please check the DOWN port for lca1-c9-asw21.nw.linkedin.com port 0/217
        
Please contact NEO team for any questions.
Follow the below steps once the troubleshooting is done.

        1) Login to lva1-netops01.prod.linkedin.com
        2) To failout traffic from the affected links do the below
        3) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket>
        4) Once the script is exectuded, and the ports are taken down, proceed with your work. Some steps below to troubleshoot
            Run iLOM fiber test
            Based on test results clean fiber
            Run the test again and if it's still showing high loss or high reflection replace the fiber
            If the interface is still down or flapping, replace the optic on one side.
            Test again.
            If the issue is still there, replace the optic on the other side.
            Run iLOM test.
            Verify that the interface is up with no errors or flaps.
        4) Once work is complete, perform the below script to bring back the traffic.
        5) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --failback
        6) If the link doesn't come back up, perform the below step
        7) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --check_port
        8) If the link is verified good after 24 hrs, the DCTECHS ticket will be auto closed.

Thanks, i will verify the console access.

 I have updated hostname against serial number in INOPS. From the top view it should be in this order XBR – DCX – DCR so that we can make consistency in racking with other DCs.Please let me know if there is any challenge in doing this.

Reopening this ticket as the server is not able to access via SSH and console as well. Tried the GUI access of the console as well, but no luck.  I checked with my colleagues as well for the access of the server as well as console and all have the same results. Tried to reset the console as well. Appreciate if you check it again and help to fix the issue.

Appreciate if you can provide an update on this server down issue. User need the server back online and the new SSD need to be allocated the server. Request you to check and prioritise this. ","09/Jan/20 10:16 AM;jcarson;[~vagopal], The device is connected to a downed port on the switch. Netops believes the solution is to reboot the switch. That would mean that all of the connected ports would lose network connectivity.  It will take some to get approval from all affected devices.  we all looking at 30+ affected devices.

Hello LCA1 Techs
Please check the DOWN port for lca1-c11-asw31.nw.linkedin.com port Ethernet118
        
Please contact NEO team for any questions.
Follow the below steps once the troubleshooting is done.

        1) Login to lva1-netops01.prod.linkedin.com
        2) To failout traffic from the affected links do the below
        3) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket>
        4) Once the script is exectuded, and the ports are taken down, proceed with your work. Some steps below to troubleshoot
            Run iLOM fiber test
            Based on test results clean fiber
            Run the test again and if it's still showing high loss or high reflection replace the fiber
            If the interface is still down or flapping, replace the optic on one side.
            Test again.
            If the issue is still there, replace the optic on the other side.
            Run iLOM test.
            Verify that the interface is up with no errors or flaps.
        4) Once work is complete, perform the below script to bring back the traffic.
        5) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --failback
        6) If the link doesn't come back up, perform the below step
        7) networktrafficshift --dctechs <DCTECHS ticket> --check_port
        8) If the link is verified good after 24 hrs, the DCTECHS ticket will be auto closed.
